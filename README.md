# Sub-Man
idea: As we all know there has been a rise in the online services such as Netflix, Amazon prime , spotify, etc in India. Sometimes we lose the track of all the services that we are subscribed to, hence we have come up with a dashboard system to keep track of all the services in a refined way. The user gets to watch over all of his payment linked to these services. His monthly and yearly expenditure on online subscriptions. We will provide the user with a login system and a dashboard in which they can check over all these things.
